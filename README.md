# FullCppRedist
AIO Installer for all latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
## Overview

Tired of bloated installers? This project offers a streamlined All-in-One (AIO) repack of the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes. We've significantly reduced the installer's footprint by removing unnecessary components from the original setups.

### How it Works

The installation is handled by a discreet Windows command script that runs silently in the background. Before anything is installed, it intelligently scans and removes any problematic or older Visual C++ Runtimes, including those from original EXE or MSI packages.

Need to clean up? Our uninstallation script can remove all detected VC++ runtimes (excluding Universal CRT), so all you need is chilling.

### Universal CRT (UCRT)

The Universal CRT is a vital component, seamlessly integrated with the VC++ 2022 redistributable. It's a built-in feature for Windows 10/11. For Windows Vista/7/8/8.1, it's typically delivered via Monthly Quality Rollups, KB3118401, or KB2999226. If you're on Windows XP, it's installed alongside the VC++ 2019 redistributable. Our repack ensures **KB3118401** is installed if UCRT isn't already present.

**Good to know:** The VC++ 2022 runtimes are fully binary compatible with VC++ 2015, 2017, and 2019. This means they cover all applications built with Visual Studio versions from 2015 through 2022, same as VC++ 2026 runtime, it cover all applications built with vs versions from 2015 to 2026

**warning** the VC++ 2026 runtimes will only support Windows 10/11 and their Windows Server equivalents only
don't worry, the repack will install the vs 22-26 on the compatible system only
